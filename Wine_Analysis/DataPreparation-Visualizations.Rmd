Basic Cleaning and Preparation

# This is because there are only very few rows with quality of 9, and there are no observations with quality of 9 in the red wine dataset
white_wine_filtered <- white_wine %>% filter(quality != 9)

# Randomly select 1,500 rows from each dataset
# This is because there are around 3 times more observations for white wine, which might lead to misconceptions when visualized based on count

Visualization 1: Quality Distribution by Wine Type
 To show how wine quality is distributed across red and white wines
```{r}
ggplot(wine_data_combined, aes(x = quality, fill = wine_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Count of Wine Quality Ratings by Wine Type", x = "Quality Rating", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Red" = "red", "White" = "lightblue"), name = "wine_type") +
  # To make sure that all quality values (3 to 8) are displayed
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3, 8, 1))  

```

Visualization 2: Correlation Heatmap

```{r}
# Red wine correlation heatmap
red_wine_corr <- wine_data_combined %>% 
  filter(wine_type == "Red") %>%
  select(-wine_type) %>%
  cor()

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(as.table(red_wine_corr)), aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Freq)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "green", mid = "white", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap for Red Wines", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# White wine correlation heatmap
white_wine_corr <- wine_data_combined %>% 
  filter(wine_type == "White") %>%
  select(-wine_type) %>%
  cor()

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(as.table(white_wine_corr)), aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Freq)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "green", mid = "white", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap for White Wines", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


Visualization 3: Density Plot of Alcohol Content (Red vs. White)

```{r}
ggplot(wine_data_combined, aes(x = alcohol, fill = wine_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Alcohol Content by Wine Type", x = "Alcohol Content", y = "Density") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Red" = "red", "White" = "lightblue")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Visualization 4: Boxplot of pH Level by Wine Type and Quality

```{r}
ggplot(wine_data_combined, aes(x = factor(quality), y = pH, fill = wine_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of pH Levels by Wine Quality and Type", x = "Wine Quality", y = "pH Level") +
