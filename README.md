# Data-Visualization-Projects

# Overview
This repository showcases data visualization projects focused on diverse analytical themes. Each project involves recreating, analyzing, and improving data visualizations using R, specifically utilizing ggplot2 and related visualization techniques.

# Projects Included:
# Wine Quality Analysis Visualization:

Objective: Analyze the relationship between various chemical properties and quality ratings for red and white wines.
Data Source: Kaggle dataset on wine quality by M abdullah, 2024.
Key Insights:
White wines generally receive higher quality ratings, potentially due to higher alcohol content and better pH and sulfur level control.
Alcohol shows a strong positive correlation with quality, more so for red wines, while volatile acidity negatively impacts red wine quality.
pH level has contrasting relationships with quality in red vs. white wines.
Visualizations:
Distribution of wine quality ratings, correlation heatmaps, and density plots for alcohol content and pH levels, highlighting factors impacting wine quality.

# Electricity Usage Trends Visualization:

Objective: Recreate and improve a publicly available graph on global electricity trends.

Original Source: New York Times article titled “How Electricity Is Changing, Country by Country” by Nadja Popovich (Nov. 20, 2023).

Approach: Recreated visualization provides insights into electricity usage patterns across United States, with a focus on improved design elements for clarity and interpretation.
